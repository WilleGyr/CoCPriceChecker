## 🎯 The problem

Supercell sells gems, magic items, and resources through countless bundles — but **never lists a price per item**. Is `Build me up` (3 builder potions + 20 wall rings for 65 kr) a steal or a rip-off? Is the trader's 1000-gem rune worth more than a 500-gem book?

You can stare at the offers and guess. Or you can solve it.

## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🛒 **Universal bundle tracking** | Shop offers, gem packs, in-game trader entries — all in one place |
| 📊 **Estimated SEK value per item** | Computed live via ridge-regularized least squares across all bundles |
| 🎯 **Deal score** | See instantly which offers are bargains (`>1.0x`) and which are traps (`<1.0x`) |
| 🕒 **Bundle history** | Mark active/inactive, track what you bought, see when items last appeared |
| 🔎 **Search & filter** | Find every bundle that ever contained Book of Heroes |
| 💾 **Local-first data** | Everything in `localStorage`. Export to JSON whenever you want |
| 🔌 **Zero dependencies** | No npm. No build. No backend. Just open `index.html` |

## 📊 How it works

The core insight: each bundle is one equation in a system.

A bundle that contains `qty_a` of item A and `qty_b` of item B for `P` kronor gives us:

```
qty_a · price(A) + qty_b · price(B) = P
```

For example, **Build me up** (65 kr):

```
3 · price(Builder Potion) + 20 · price(Wall Ring) = 65
```

That's one equation, two unknowns — not solvable alone. But add another bundle that contains a Builder Potion and the system starts to constrain itself. Trader entries link gems to items (`1 · price(Book of Heroes) − 500 · price(Gem) = 0`), and official gem packs anchor gems to SEK (`500 · price(Gem) = 65`). With ~30 bundles seeded by default, the system becomes **overdetermined** — more equations than unknowns — and we solve it the way every regression problem gets solved:

$$\hat{x} = \arg\min_{x \geq 0} \, \lVert A x - b \rVert^2 + \lambda \lVert x \rVert^2$$

This is **ridge-regularized least squares**. The `λ` term keeps things stable when an item appears in only one or two bundles. Negative results (which can sneak in from noise) get clipped to zero. The result is a single SEK value for every item — and every new bundle you add either confirms or challenges those estimates.

The whole solver lives in [`src/regression.js`](src/regression.js) — about 80 lines of plain JavaScript. No `numpy`, no `mathjs`.

## 🚀 Quick start

### Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WilleGyr/CoCPriceChecker.git
cd CoCPriceChecker
```

### Open

```bash
# Windows
start index.html

# macOS
open index.html

# Linux
xdg-open index.html
```

Or, for proper image loading and dev tooling, run a local server:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```

That's it. No `npm install`. No build step. No backend.

## 🎮 Usage

### Adding a bundle

1. Click **+ New bundle**
2. Pick the type:
   - **Shop** — bought with SEK, contents are what you receive
   - **Gem-pack** — bought with SEK, contents are gems
   - **Trader** — bought with gems (add `Gem` with a **negative** qty as the cost)
3. Fill in price, date, contents
4. Toggle `Active in shop` if it's currently available, `Purchased by me` if you've bought it
5. Save

### Reading the valuation

Open the **Valuation** tab and click **Recompute valuation**:

- **Value per item** — estimated SEK value, sorted highest-first. The *Bundles* column shows how many equations the model used for that item — more = higher confidence.
- **Deal score per bundle** — every active bundle ranked by `value / price`:
  - `> 1.0x` → 🟢 good deal (you get more value than you pay)
  - `< 1.0x` → 🔴 overpriced

### Backup & restore

Open the **Data** tab → **Export JSON**. All bundles export to one file you can import later or sync between devices.
